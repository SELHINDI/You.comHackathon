git clone https://github.com/SELHINDI/You.comHackathon.git
cd You.comHackathon
```

2. **Set your API key**

```

3. **Run the server**
```bash
python streaming_server.py
```

4. **Open in browser**
```

```

---

## How to Use

1. **Enter Brand Name** - e.g., "Tesla", "Nike", "Starbucks"

---

## Files

- `streaming_server.py` - Main server (all-in-one file)
- `test_api.py` - Test your You.com API connection
- `README.md` - This file

---

## How It Works

The system uses **6 specialized AI agents** that work sequentially:

```
Brand Info → Agent 1 (Trends) → Agent 2 (Ideas) → Agent 3 (Script) 
→ Agent 4 (Thumbnail) → Agent 5 (Video) → Agent 6 (A/B Test) → Results
```

Each agent uses You.com's Advanced Agent API to:
- Research current trends
- Generate creative content
- Plan video production
- Design testing strategies

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" error
- Make sure the server is running (`python streaming_server.py`)
- Check that you're using `http://localhost:8080`

### Empty content ("Generated content")
- Verify your API key: `echo $YOU_API_KEY`
- Test the API: `python test_api.py`
- Check API quota at [You.com dashboard](https://api.you.com)

### Port already in use
- Change PORT in `streaming_server.py` (line 211)
- Use a different port like 8081 or 8082

---

## Alternative Setup (No Dependencies)

The project uses only Python built-in libraries except for `requests`:

```bash
pip install requests
python streaming_server.py
```

---

## Output Example

After running the pipeline, you'll get:

**Trends:**
- "Short-form vertical video dominates 2025 social media..."
- "Authentic behind-the-scenes content builds trust..."
- "User-generated content drives engagement..."

**Script:**
```
HOOK (0-5s): "Wait, Tesla just did WHAT?!"
BODY (5-20s): "Here's how Tesla revolutionized..."
CTA (20-30s): "Link in bio to learn more!"
```

Plus thumbnail design, video editing plan, and A/B testing strategy!
